## Overview
On a trip to New York City, the most useful form of transportation was a fleet of rental bikes, the Citi Bike. This is an analysis of the data shared by Citi Bike to see if the same business idea could work in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results
1. This graph shows hour of the day on the Y-axis and number of bikes rented out on the X-axis. The two peaks, one in the morning and one in the evening, shows that this could be a popular option for those choosing to bike to and from work.

2. Below is a dashboard preview that shows a pie chart of customer types, subscribers and one-time users. The break down is 78% subscribers and 22% one-time users. This is a good sign for the business as subscribers represent consistent income.

3. Next is a heatmap of users broken down by gender, and day of the week. The most active time for bike rentals is Thursday and Friday by male customers.

4. Lastly we have a similar heatmap zoomed in further to show most active hours. If you click the link to view the full graph you can see that the most active time is Thursday in the morning and evening by males.

5. This graph shows the length of time that the bikes are rented for, most for about five minutes.

6. This is a similar graph to the previous one except we get a breakdown by gender. We learn that most users are male.

7. This heatmap shows the times that bikes are returned. The times are very close to times they were checked out, another illustration of the trend of short trip duration.

## Summary
The big takeaways from this analysis are that these bikes are big with commuters, and a favorite mode of transportation for short distances. Would this same business model work in Des Moines?

Two further visualizations you could create to help your analysis would be to look at the distances traveled in the average rental, as well as the differences in activity between weekdays and weekends. This would show you if there was much more interest in the service beyond to and from work. To determine if this would work in Iowa you would need to find statistics on how many short distance commuters there are in the city.
